# It's getting csspooky in WDI!

During his life, Pierre was a web designer. As punishment for the heinous sin of using `<table>` tags for the layout of his webpages, his ghost has been doomed to haunt the attached `index.html` for all time.

That's fine - in life, he spent all his time on the computer anyway. But the page is missing all the CSS necessary for him to haunt effectively! Your job is to put the CSS back in order, and then monitor Pierre to make sure he's doing his job.

Copy and paste the CSS in `starter.txt` into the appropriate places in `style.css`. When finished, Pierre will:

- Continuously bob slightly up and down, and wobble from side-to-side.
- Be invisible, except for when the mouse is on top of him.
- Start just off the top-left corner of the window...
  - Move to the bottom-left corner, then...
  - Move to the top-right corner while doing a forward flip, then...
  - Move to the center-left edge while doing a backflip, then...
  - Pause, then...
  - Vanish off the bottom-right corner, then...
  - Repeat.

You will use **all** of the CSS in `starter.txt`. You **should** only modify `style.css`. You **should not** modify anything in `index.html`.

See a completed example at the link below. Peek at the CSS only if you're totally stuck!
